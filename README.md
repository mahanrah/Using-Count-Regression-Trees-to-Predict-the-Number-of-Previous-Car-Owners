# Using Count Regression Trees to Predict the Number of Previous Car Owners

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this project was to research count regression trees, and to apply them to a dataset of Irish used cars. The aim of this application was to predict the number of previous owners based on variables such as vehicle registration year and price. An in depth understanding of the CORE method and its applications was developed through a review of existing literature. The chosen dataset was then analysed, imputed and prepared for inclusion in the model. The  Analysis found that the model was biased toward lower numbers of previous owners, and did not perform well for higher values of this variable.
